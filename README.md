# enron-fraud-detection

## Overview: 
The goal of the project is to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset. This data set contains 21 financial features for 146 employees and identifies around 18 of these as person of interest (poi). We want to build a model which can predict whether a person will be a person of interest based on this data
